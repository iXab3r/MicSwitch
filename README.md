# Intro
There are dozens of different audio chat apps like Discord, TeamSpeak, Ventrilo, Skype, in-game audio chats, etc. And all of them have DIFFERENT ways of handling push-to-talk and always-on microphone functionality. I bet many of you know how distracting it could be when someone forgets to turn off a microphone. I will try to explain what I mean using a feature matrix.

MicSwitch allows you to mute/unmute your system microphone using a predefined system-wide hotkey which will affect any program that uses microphone (no more heavy breathing during Skype conferences, hooray!)
Also it supports configurable mute/unmute sounds(similar to TeamSpeak/Ventrilo) and a configurable overlay with scaling/transparency support. All these features allow you to seamlessly switch between chat apps and use THE SAME input system with overlay and notifications support.

## How to build application
* I am extensively using [git-submodules](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule "git-submodules") so you may have to run extra commands (git submodule update) if your git-client does not fully support this tech. I would highly recommend to use [Git Extensions](https://gitextensions.github.io/ "Git Extensions") which is awesome, free and open-source and makes submodules integration seamless
* The main "catch-up-moment" is that you need to run InitSymlinks.cmd before building an application - this is due to the fact that git symlinks are not supported on some older versions of Windows and I am using them to create links to submodules
* I am usually using [Jetbrains Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/ "Jetbrains Rider") so there MAY be some issues if you are using Microsoft Visual Studio, although I am trying to keep things compatible

### Build from command line

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iXab3r/MicSwitch.git
cd MicSwitch
git submodule init # (if you have error accessing DeploymentScripts repository simply ignore that submodule - it's used only to build/publish installer)
git submodule update --checkout
InitSymlinks.cmd
dotnet build Sources/MicSwitch
```

That's it. Portable version will be in **bin** folder. Framework-dependent version

## Linux/MacOS Support ?
Probably not going to happen in the nearest future because in it's core MicSwitch is a WPF application, technology that Microsoft does not want to port at all.
Migrating to something cross-platform like Avalon, Xamarin is an option, but not a cheap one, unfortunately I don't have so much spare time to do it now.

Meanwhile you could take a look at
### MacOS
**MuteKey** (thanks to @benpeter for finding it): https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mutekey/id1509590766?mt=12

### Linux
